Pointer in C++
==============

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are a powerful feature in C++ that allow direct memory access and manipulation.

Declaration and Initialization
------------------------------
To declare a pointer, use the asterisk (*) symbol:

int* ptr; // pointer to int

You can initialize a pointer with the address of a variable using the address-of operator (&):

int x = 10;
int* ptr = &x; // ptr now holds the address of x

Dereferencing a Pointer
-----------------------
Dereferencing means accessing the value stored at the memory address the pointer points to. Use the asterisk (*) operator:

int y = *ptr; // y gets the value of x (10)

Pointer Arithmetic
------------------
Pointers can be incremented or decremented. When you increment a pointer, it points to the next memory location of its type:

ptr++; // moves to the next int location

Null Pointer
------------
A pointer that is not assigned any address is called a null pointer. It is good practice to initialize pointers to nullptr:

int* ptr = nullptr;

Pointers and Arrays
-------------------
Arrays and pointers are closely related. The array name is a constant pointer to the first element:

int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int* p = arr; // p points to arr[0]

You can access array elements using pointer arithmetic:

*(p + 2); // accesses arr[2]

Pointers to Pointers
--------------------
You can have pointers to pointers (multiple levels of indirection):

int x = 5;
int* p = &x;
int** pp = &p;

Dynamic Memory Allocation
------------------------
Pointers are used with new and delete for dynamic memory allocation:

int* p = new int; // allocate memory
*p = 20;
delete p; // free memory

Common Mistakes
---------------
- Dereferencing uninitialized or null pointers (causes undefined behavior)
- Memory leaks (forgetting to delete dynamically allocated memory)
- Dangling pointers (using pointers after memory is freed)

Summary
-------
Pointers are essential in C++ for dynamic memory, efficient array handling, and implementing data structures like linked lists and trees. Proper understanding and careful usage are important to avoid bugs and memory issues.
